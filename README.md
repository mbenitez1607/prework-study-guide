# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for bootcamp students doing their prework to be able to take notes as thye learn new topics.

This should be a handy resource to help students find tips they found helpful while doing their prework.

The Prework Study Guid has been a useful refresher for me on how to use HTML and CSS basic concepts, as well as an introduction to JavaScript.
